Chris Deal,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Observation,5/11/2022,More N will be applied to Trt 1 at sidedress to achieve 50 unit difference from Trt 2
Chris Deal,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Observation,5/11/2022,Field has good fertility levels (have spent several years building P&K levels)
Chris Deal,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Observation,5/11/2022,Field has been continuous no-till / cover crop since 2016
Chris Deal,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Observation,5/11/2022,Field is pattern-tiled
Chris Deal,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Observation,5/11/2022,LATE Spring due to wet & cold. Burndown/pre-emerge applied on a VERY hot day. Could notice the impact of the spray within a couple hours (agronomist said it was the 32% more than the glyphosate). Planting date was also later than desired due to spring rains & cold. Pattern tiling was helpful in this field.

Chris Deal,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Observation,,The planting layout appears to have hybrids cross the trial area. Will review this in the data to see if there's a significant impact on the yields
Chris Deal,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Observation,,"After lots of conversation with agronomist & other advisers with cover crop experience, I cut down significantly on the time between the rye burndown & planting date (only 5 days). Did this because of the late date AND because the burndown appeared to act relatively quickly"
Chris Deal,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Observation,12/1/2022,"even though it created a negative profitability impact for me, I very much appreciate having a better sense of the appropriateness of my N applications."
