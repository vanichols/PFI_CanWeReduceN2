,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Previous crop,,corn
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,No. reps,,4 reps
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Strip size,,40 ft wide x length of field = 2.11 ac/strip. Strip is 16 rows wide (30-in. row-widths)
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Treatments,,"Trt 1 Typical rate: 157.5 lb N/ac as turkey litter, UAN+ATS, UAN sidedress ;Trt 2 Reduced rate: 105 lb N/ac as turkey litter, UAN+ATS"
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Cover crop -- seeding,8/23/2021,cereal rye overseeded into standing corn with Hagie highboy at 65 lb/ac
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Cover crop -- termination,5/21/2022,All Trts: Volley ATZ Lite NXT (60 oz/ac)
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Fall Grazing -- begin,,
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Fall Grazing -- end,,
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Spring Grazing -- begin,1/3/2022,"49 bred heifers turned out 1/3/22, out until 3/17/21, then out occassionally weather dependent in reducing numbers as heifers had calves and were relocated. On 4/10/21, heifers were no longer accessing field, but cow herd was moved to field, 27 cows starting 4/10 and calving"
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Spring Grazing -- end,5/15/2022,All cows removed with cows finished calving
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Corn planting,5/19/2022,"35,500 seeds/ac in 30-in. row-widths"
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Tillage,5/18/2022,Vertical tillage using a Kuhn Krause excelerator-soil surface was crusted from cattle grazing and made seed depth control challenging
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Fertilizer,2/3/2022,turkey litter applied at 2.3 ton/ac. 57.7-49-38.5 lb NPK per ton of litter. Resulted in 132.7 lb N/ac; 113 lb P/ac; 89 lb K/ac. Available N per ISU = 0.55*132.7 = 73 lb N/ac
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Fertilizer,5/18/2022,All trts: Applied with sprayer: 32 lb N/ac and 8.6 lb S/ac as UAN(28) and ATS
,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Fertilizer,6/7/2022,Trt 1: 52.5 lb N/ac as UAN(28). $0.61/lb N (Nathan's quoted price); $11.35/ac application cost (ISU custom rate)
