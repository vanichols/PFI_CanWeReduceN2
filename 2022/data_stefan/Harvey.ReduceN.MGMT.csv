Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Previous crop,,soybeans
Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,No. reps,,4 reps
Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Strip size,,20 ft x 875 ft
Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Treatments,,Trt 1 Typical rate: 114 lb N/ac ;Trt 2 Reduced rate: 65 lb N/ac
Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Cover crop -- seeding,10/5/2021,cereal rye drilled in 10-in. rows at 50 lb/ac

Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Corn planting,4/27/2022,"30-in. row-widths at 32,000 seeds/ac"
Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Tillage,,
Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Fertilizer,1/16/2022,Both Trts: 6-30-30 dry P/K applied to soybean stubble
Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Fertilizer,4/27/2022,Both Trts: 5 gallons 6-24-6 applied in furrow at planting. Net weight of product per gallon = 11.09 lb. Total pounds of product applied with 5 gal = 55.45. Amounts to 3 lb N/ac (N cost = $1/lb N = $3/ac)
Robert Harvey,Can We Reduce N and Improve ROI?,Fertilizer,5/20/2022,Trt 1: UAN 32% sidress application standard rate is 30 gallon/acre (105 lb N/ac). Trt 2: reduced rate at 16 gallon/acre (56 lb N/ac). N cost = $1.20/ lb N
